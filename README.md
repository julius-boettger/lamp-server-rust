# Lamp Server
REST API built with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) to manipulate [supported Govee lamps through its Developer API](https://govee.readme.io/reference/govee-developer-api).

The main feature of this project (which the [Govee Home app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.govee.home) does not support) is its use as a sunrise alarm clock.
